						<p>Under the big apple tree in the backyard stand a little fluffly bear named Walf Brun. Red and shiny apples are being picked from the tree branch.<br><br>Walf is bringing them home so that Mama Brun can make a big fresh apple pie for tonight's dessert, and together with Papa Brun, Walf will eat them happily.
						<br><br>Now, who is this Walf we're talking about?</p>

						<p>Walf and his parents live in a small village called Wutkroft Woods. Walf's house is located at the east of Wutkroft Woods. Their house may not be so big, but it's nice and warm. Walf Brun has been living here since he was born. Mama and Papa Brun have always taken care of him with all the love and attention he needs, giving him a kind-hearted personality<br><br>Walf loves picking flowers, helping people, and reading story books. But above all, he loves to sleep and dream. Sometimes he would lay under the big apple tree, and starts to doze off when the sun is warm and the wind is swirling gently. Walf likes to tell his friends what Mama Brun always says, "a good 8-hours sleep is a great start for the day! Dreaming and sleeping can take me anywhere i want!"</p>

						<p id="font-kecil">His dream world is his wonderland. Every day, Walf tells his parents and friends about the adventure he had the night before: treasure hunting, flying, becoming a king, saving the world, and so much more. His dream varies, but there's one thing that doesn't change. He still helps others even in his dreams. 
						<br><br>In his dreams, he always finds someone in need. And with his power, he helps animals in distress and panic, to be calm and relaxedâ€¦ What power he posses, you ask? Well, he has a secret weapon hidden in his body which will gives out a nice and relaxing fragance, making his enemies surrender, and the others happy, saving the day of his dreams. Walf love his power very much, and there is no doubt that he can't wait to tell you his adventures he has when the sun is sleeping.</p>

						<p>Now, the night has come, and the silver moon is shining above Wutkroft Woods. Walf has enjoyed the delicious apple pie Mama Brun made. And after brushing his teeth clean, it is time for Mama and Papa Brun to read Walf a bed-time story. This night, a story about a faraway kingdom is being told. After Walf falls asleep, his parents give him a good night kiss and leave his room. And now, his adventure begins.</p>
